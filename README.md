# Email Spam Detector

This repository contains a Python project for building an email spam detector. Spam mail, also known as junk mail, refers to emails that are sent to a massive number of users at once, often containing cryptic messages, scams, or phishing content. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can recognize and classify emails as spam or non-spam.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of labeled emails, where each email is labeled as spam or non-spam (ham). This dataset will be used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the email data to remove irrelevant information, such as HTML tags, special characters, and stopwords. This step aims to transform the email text into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.

3. **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed email data, such as word frequency, n-grams, or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). These features will be used as input for training the machine learning model.

4. **Model Training**: Use machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forest, to train a classification model on the labeled email dataset. The model will learn patterns and characteristics that distinguish spam from non-spam emails.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This step helps assess the effectiveness of the model in classifying emails correctly.

6. **Prediction**: Utilize the trained model to predict the spam or non-spam status of new, unseen emails. This allows the spam detector to be applied to real-world email data for practical use.

## Repository Files

The repository includes the following files:

1. `spam.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the email spam detector. This notebook provides step-by-step instructions and explanations of the data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, model evaluation, and email prediction.

2. `model.pkl`: Pickle file containing the trained machine learning model. This file stores the trained model's parameters and can be used for loading the model without retraining.

3. `vectorizer.pkl`: Pickle file containing the vectorizer used for feature extraction. This file stores the vectorizer's parameters and can be used for transforming new email data into the same feature representation as the training data.

## How to Use

To use this project and run the email spam detector, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Getrudetrudy01/email-spam-detector.git
   ```

2. Open the `spam.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and run the email spam detector.

4. If you want to use the trained model for prediction on new email data, make sure to have the `model.pkl` and `vectorizer.pkl` files in the same directory as the notebook. You can load the model and the vectorizer from these files and apply them to new email data.

## Conclusion

The email spam detector project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to identify and classify spam emails. By training a model on a labeled email dataset, the project aims to develop a spam detector that can effectively distinguish between spam and non-spam emails. The Jupyter Notebook provided allows for an interactive and flexible environment to explore, develop, and enhance the email spam detection process.
